### Running the Program

Main class: Breakout.java

Data files needed: (in resources folder)

- lvl1.txt
- lvl2.txt
- lvl3.txt
- lvl4.txt
- lvl5.txt
- paddle.gif
- ball.gif

Key/Mouse inputs:

- Mouse: Launch ball off paddle to start level 

- Left-Arrow: Move paddle to left

- Right-Arrow: Move paddle to right


Cheat keys:
- L: extra life
- R: Reset ball to paddle in middle
- 1-5: go to level x
- 6-9: go to level 5
- P: extra 100 points

Known Bugs:
- Sometimes the ball will get stuck inside a block. I patched this bug so if it happens the ball will jump a short distance out of the block to avoid staying inside it.
- Sometimes there's a graphical artifact of a power-up circle at the bottom of the screen


Extra credit:
- Added the one shot bonus level (lvl 5)


### Notes/Assumptions
In addition to using the number keys to access different levels you can also use P cheat to get enough points to move on to the next level in a more "natural" transition. 
Right now I can't think of any assumptions I had to make.

### Impressions
I rather liked this project. I think it was a cool trial by fire type of deal that forced me to learn a lot. 
I especially used online documentation a lot more than I ever had to learn how to use the JavaFX platform. 
I definitely over-shot what I thought would be able to accomplish on this project. Next time I will need to set more 
attainable goals as well is budget my time better (i.e. not 10 hours on the last day).
