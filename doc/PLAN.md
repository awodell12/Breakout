# Game Plan
## Austin Odell


### Breakout Variant: Super Breakout
I liked this variant because it kept to the simplicity and original style of the base game while adding in new power-ups and point drops. I also liked it because it seemed doable to be able to implement the features in this version. 

### General Level Descriptions
1. Just four lines of normal bricks

### Bricks Ideas
- Standard Bricks: Break in single collision
- Tough (maybe metal) Bricks: Take 5 collisions to break
- Indestructible bricks: Unlimited collision, don't need to be cleared to be level.
- Moving Bricks: Move horizontally across the screen 

### Power Up Ideas
1. Extra life
2. Slow ball
3. Grow paddle 
4. Shooting a laser out of the paddle
5. Sticky paddle. Ball sticks to paddle and can be moved and re-shot
6. Multi-ball - Add in additional balls, must have at least 1 to survive (can lose others at no life cost)
7. Point drops: Can gain extra points (or lose points) from collecting these
